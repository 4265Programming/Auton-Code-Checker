# Auton-Code-Checker
Checks auton files

This project is no longer active, or applicable. It was created for the 2015 pre-match writable autonomous system as a way to check autonomous programs before they were actually used. It never ended up being used. You can refer to the 2015 repository for information on how the system works.
